## Instructor
Stephen Houser <houser@maine.edu>

## Course Objectives
The objectives of the course are as follows.
* Develop basic skill in app development on iOS, Android, and hybrid platforms.
* Develop moderate skill and knowledge of a single platform.
* Develop basic skill in server-side development for mobile platforms.
* Understand the design and interface layout process for mobile applications.

## Prerequisites and Expectations
* COS 285 or Permission of the Instructor

The course involves a fair amount of independent learning, experimentation, and work. Internet resources on mobile app development are plentiful and class time is limited. You will be expected to read (or at least skim and absorb) enough of these materials to be prepared for class.

Be prepeared to work across platforms and with multiple (new to you) languages. There will be a fair amount of moving from one technology to another throughout the course and within a single project.

## Textbook
None. We will be using articles, tutorials, and materials freely available on the Internet throughout the course. Links will be provided on the course website.

## Projects
The course is entirely project-based. There will be one (1) introductory and five (5) programming projects throughout the course. The projects will require you to develop mobile applications on a variety of platforms and technologies.

### Schedule of Projects 

| Project   | Project               | Possible Points |
| :---: | :---                      | :---:           |
| 0   | GitHub                      |    1            |
| 1   | iOS Tasklist (mini)         |    2            |
| 2   | Android Task List (mini)    |    2            |
| 3   | Hybrid Task List (mini)     |    2            |          
| 4   | *Choice* Task List (full)   |    2            |          
| 5   | *Student Designed*          |    4            |          


Your code will be submitted (checked in) on [GitHub](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/30673287-usm-cos-460-540-computer-networks) to an assignment for each project. Details on what needs to be submitted will be included with each assignment. In all cases, you should submit only source code, no binary executable files. 

Your code must compile and run on systems other than your own, specifically the instructor's system. Be diligent not to include absolute paths or other common mistakes that prevent your code being compiled and executed on other systems.

Code should work and be your own creation. There are numerous sources of information on the Internet, including code. However, your submissions should be your own work not that of others cut-and-pasted into your projects or that of your classmates. Plagiarism is a serious offence and will be treated accordingly.

### Project Grading Rubric
The grading rubric for each project and the presentation is extremely simple.

#### Project 0 and Presentation:
